# VsProspectorInfo
A clientside only mod to save trees by not having to write down the values of your prospecting. If you don't need it purely client-side there is also https://github.com/Wooza/ProspectTogether as an alternative with changes regarding sharing data.
## Installation
Just drop the file into your mods folder. You just need this mod on the client, no serverside installation needed.

    .pi showoverlay [true,false] - Show or hide the overlay on the map. Toggles without argument.
    .pi showborder [true,false] - Show or hide the border around chunks. Toggles without argument.
    .pi showgui [true,false] - Show the GUI where you can configure the mode (default or heatmap) and select the ore that should be heatmapped.
    .pi setcolor (overlay|border|lowheat|highheat) [0-255] [0-255] [0-255] [0-255] - Sets the color of the respective element.

## Usage

Whenever you finish prospecting a chunk, the data is saved into the ModData folder and added to the chunk info of the world map. This is just a 1:1 parsing of the chat message that the prospecting pick sends. 

The mod renders a transparent square of all chunks that have been prospected. If a chunk is re-prospected, the message is simply overwritten. The rendering of these squares can be toggled with the .pi command.

After prospecting, the info will be displayed in the tooltip of the minimap when hovering over the chunk. This info is stored in %Vintage_Story_Data%/ModData/YourWorldId/vsprospectorinfo.data and is client side only.

### Heatmap

A map mode that displays the relative density of the ores on the map via a color gradient. Can be enabled/disabled and switched between displaying the density of just one ore and displaying the density of all ores (The highest density per chunk is picked).

## Compiling
Clone the repository with submodules included: "git clone --recursive"
To compile the mod you also need to set 2 environment variables:
- VINTAGE_STORY => the path to the game directory e.g. c:\games\vintagestory
- VINTAGE_STORY_DATA => the path to the games data directory typically located somewhere in appdata e.g. C:\Users\MyUser\AppData\Roaming\VintagestoryData

## Create a release
To create a release just compile the solution in Release configuration. A folder named "release" should appear in the solution directory.
This can then be zipped to be uploaded to the mod-db.
